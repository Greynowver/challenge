                    Loch Ness (/ˌlɒx ˈnɛs/; Scottish Gaelic: Loch Nis [l̪ˠɔx ˈniʃ]) is a large freshwater loch in the Scottish Highlands
                    extending for approximately 37 kilometres (23 miles) southwest of Inverness. It takes its name from the River Ness,
                    which flows from the northern end. Loch Ness is best known for alleged sightings of the cryptozoological Loch Ness Monster,
                    also known affectionately as "Nessie" (Scottish Gaelic: Niseag). It is one of a series of interconnected,
                    murky bodies of water in Scotland; its water visibility is exceptionally low due to a high peat content in the surrounding soil.
                    The southern end connects to Loch Oich by the River Oich and a section of the Caledonian Canal.
                    The northern end connects to Loch Dochfour via the River Ness, which then ultimately leads to the North Sea via the Moray Firth.

                    Loch Ness is the second-largest Scottish loch by surface area after Loch Lomond at 56 km2 (22 sq mi), but due to its great depth
                    it is the largest by volume in the British Isles. Its deepest point is 230 metres (126 fathoms; 755 feet),
                    making it the second deepest loch in Scotland after Loch Morar. It contains more water than all the lakes in England and Wales combined,
                    and is the largest body of water in the Great Glen, which runs from Inverness in the north to Fort William in the south.
                    Its surface is 16 metres (52 feet) above sea level. It contains a single, artificial island named Cherry Island
                    (Scottish Gaelic: Eilean Muireach) at the southwestern end. There are nine villages around the loch, as well as Urquhart Castle;
                    the village of Drumnadrochit contains a "Loch Ness Centre and Exhibition".

                    The Loch Ness Monster, or Nessie (Scottish Gaelic: Uilebheist Loch Nis[3]), is a creature in Scottish folklore that is said to inhabit
                    Loch Ness in the Scottish Highlands. It is often described as large, long-necked, and with one or more humps protruding from the water.
                    Popular interest and belief in the creature has varied since it was brought to worldwide attention in 1933. Evidence of its existence
                    is anecdotal, with a number of disputed photographs and sonar readings.

                    The scientific community regards the Loch Ness Monster as a phenomenon without biological basis, explaining sightings as hoaxes, wishful thinking,
                    and the misidentification of mundane objects.[4] The pseudoscience and subculture of cryptozoology has placed particular emphasis on the creature.
